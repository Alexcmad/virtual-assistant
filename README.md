User has the choice to use either the fine-tuned model or GPT3.5-Turbo.
##### GPT3.5-Turbo:
- uses more tokens per command
- can be provided with conversation history to allow it to use context clues when interpreting natural language
- may very occasionally refuse commands or say 'okay,  [carrying out command]' which is not valid command format
- in the above event, conversation history can be manually reset with the command 'reset' or 'thank you' or 'thanks'
- conversation history automatically resets after a certain amount of commands

##### Fine-tuned GPT3-Davinci (as of today):
- uses much less tokens per command
- however, as a trade off, training the model uses a great deal of tokens. In the future, additional training should only be done when commands get added to save money 
- no conversation history
- very concise and only ever gives more than us required of it
- will not refuse commands, but may misinterpret them if the intention is not clear
- probably faster but needs a lot of training data to be as accurate as Turbo.

In all I prefer using turbo for the more natural interaction with message history, but in the later stages of this project I may train a really good davinci (or other) model and use it instead for the sake of my wallet. Don't know how training a turbo model would even work but it would be interesting to use if they make that possible.
